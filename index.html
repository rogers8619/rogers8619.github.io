              Get rise to network solutions, as customers requested help in designing, installing and supporting networks. Network-oriented resellers, also known as network integrators, initially focused on Novell's NetWare product, but eventually shifted their network solutions' emphasis to Windows and open source operating systems, as those software platforms gained networking capabilities.
    
              Internet expands possibilities for IT solution providers
              The arrival of the internet pushed the IT solution industry in new directions. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, managed service providers began to emerge. These companies took advantage of the internet as a cost effective means to remotely oversee their customers' on-premises solutions using lights-out management. This development quickly turned remote monitoring and management into another component of IT solutions.
              
              More recently, cloud computing has further expanded IT solution possibilities. Solution providers now offer customers infrastructure as a service, software as a service and other on-demand offerings. The provider either builds and supports its own proprietary cloud services or resells (or recommends) the services of a public cloud provider. Examples of cloud providers include:
              Amazon Web Services - a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.com.
              Google Cloud Platform - a suite of public cloud computing services offered by Google.
              Microsoft Azure -  Microsoft's public cloud computing platform.
              Salesforce Service Cloud - a customer relationship management (CRM) platform for customer service and support, based on Salesforce's CRM software for sales professionals.
              Cloud solution providers offer consulting and professional services around one or more cloud platforms, helping customers use public, private and hybrid cloud environments to solve business problems. </p>
